# TodoList and Google Calendar AutoScheduler
Tired of forgetting todo list entries? 

Can't ever find time in your schedule?

This TodoList also doubles as an autoscheduler for your tasks and prioritizes the tasks that you need to get done. By linking your Google Calendar to the TodoList, you only need to click one button to find time for all the tasks that you need to get done.
